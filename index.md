## Welcome to Pretty Girl Products

This site serves as a professional portfolio designed to maintain and preview the content of documentation in my company's file cabinet using Markdown files in [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ksray2/my-school-profile/edit/master/index.md). This Github Pages repository will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the page using Markdown content.

### Jekyll

This Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme selected in [repository settings](https://github.com/ksray2/my-school-profile/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
